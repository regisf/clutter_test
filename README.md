# Sprite test with Clutter

This is a demonstration program to guess how fast is clutter. 


## Compilation

Ensure you have `clutter-devel` (on RPM based distro) or `clutter-dev` (on Debian based distro) install.

Type

    $ make 


That's done.
There's a lot of warning due to the age of the program.
